Machine Learning Notebooks
==========================

This project aims at teaching you the fundamentals of Machine Learning in
python. It contains the example code and solutions to the exercises in my O'Reilly book [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do):

Simply open the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks you are interested in:

* Using [jupyter.org's notebook viewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/index.ipynb)
    * note: [github.com's notebook viewer](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/index.ipynb) also works but it is slower and the math formulas are not displayed correctly,
* or by cloning this repository and running Jupyter locally. This option lets you play around with the code. In this case, follow the installation instructions below.

Many files are here is edited and differ from the original so do follow the book before executing the files
